#BMA

##Tool to sift through and change key words in files and filename

This is an application that I built which will:
		- sift through files and find the text you indicated
		- return a new file with the indicated text you want it replaced
			- The new file name will be based off this input
		- the type of file is up to you at the end


Instructions:
		- You first must move the desired file you wish to be fully edited into the same directory as BMA
		- rename filetype to .txt
			Example:
				$ mv  ~/BMA/hello.go ~/BMA/hello.txt
		- Run the following command:
		#	// Here is where I will explain Cobra Command Use -- ./BMA run
